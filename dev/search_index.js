It contains the following fields:\n\nstatus: Indicates the output of the solver. Use show_statuses() for the full list;\nsolution: The final approximation returned by the solver (default: an uninitialized vector like nlp.meta.x0);\nobjective: The objective value at solution (default: Inf);\ndual_feas: The dual feasibility norm at solution (default: Inf);\nprimal_feas: The primal feasibility norm at solution (default: 0.0 if unconstrained, Inf otherwise);\nmultipliers: The Lagrange multipliers wrt to the constraints (default: an uninitialized vector like nlp.meta.y0);\nmultipliers_L: The Lagrange multipliers wrt to the lower bounds on the variables (default: an uninitialized vector like nlp.meta.x0 if there are bounds, or a zero-length vector if not);\nmultipliers_U: The Lagrange multipliers wrt to the upper bounds on the variables (default: an uninitialized vector like nlp.meta.x0 if there are bounds, or a zero-length vector if not);\niter: The number of iterations computed by the solver (default: -1);\nelapsed_time: The elapsed time computed by the solver (default: Inf);\nsolver_specific::Dict{Symbol,Any}: A solver specific dictionary.\n\nThe constructor preallocates storage for the fields above. Special storage may be used for multipliers_L and multipliers_U by passing them to the constructor. For instance, if a problem has few bound constraints, those multipliers could be held in sparse vectors.\n\nThe following fields indicate whether the information above has been updated and is reliable:\n\nsolution_reliable\nobjective_reliable\nresiduals_reliable (for dual_feas and primal_feas)\nmultipliers_reliable (for multipliers)\nbounds_multipliers_reliable (for multipliers_L and multipliers_U)\niter_reliable\ntime_reliable\nsolver_specific_reliable.\n\nSetting fields using one of the methods set_solution!(), set_objective!(), etc., also marks the field value as reliable.\n\nThe reset!() method marks all fields as unreliable.\n\nnlp is mandatory to set default optional fields.
