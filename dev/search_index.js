You can call SolverCore.show_statuses() to see them. If you need more specific statuses, create an issue.\nUse the set_...!(stats, ...) functions from SolverCore to update the stats. For instance, set_objective!(stats, f), set_time!(stats, time() - start_time), and set_dual_residual!(stats, gnorm).\nDon't log when verbose == 0. When logging, use @info log_header(...) and @info log_row(...).\nWrite docstrings for SolverName.
